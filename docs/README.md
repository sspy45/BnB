#Features
My idea for the AirBnB clone will be to create a pet-sitting website for people who need to travel.  Functionality will be similar to AirBnB.  

Users will be able to search by location through google map api, amongst other filtering options. Users will be able to book stays for their pet as well as offer their own services.

Bonus features will include allowing users to message one another, have public profiles.
